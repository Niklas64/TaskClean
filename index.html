    <!--When I read the instructions I’m not sure what I’m supposed to accomplish.
    I would say the code is fairly easy to read and understand but I have added some comment and changed name on some variables.
    Regarding extendable functionality I’m not sure what you mean, extend with more price settings? If so the switch statements
    can easily be extended without rewrite what there is today. If more and more different products come in I would suggest to
    add new price-calculator.js and maybe finally have a master.js to call them. Also different product names to keep track.
    The testing with runner.html works fine and I have made some comments in price-calculator.specs but I have no test result file. I have been evaluated
    the code with .Net and could of course have set up a unit test there.-->
